#summary Native Mac OS X application which sends incoming keystrokes to multiple applications.

== Introduction ==

CloneKeys duplicates (clones) incoming keystrokes and sends them to the applications setup in the main CloneKeys configuration window.

This is mostly useful for multi-boxing in games. (Open up multiple copies of World of Warcraft and use CloneKeys to send the same keystrokes to multiple windows simultaneously.)

== Details ==

Basic instructions for use:

  # Start up multiple copies of your favorite game. (Say *World of Warcraft*)
  # Start up *CloneKeys*
  # Click *Add* button in the *CloneKeys* toolbar.
    * Click a *World of Warcraft* game window
  # Repeat step 3 as needed
  # Play

== TODO ==

Possible improvements / plans for the future:

  * Cross-machine sending. Cross-compatiable with keyclone? Discuss with keyclone author.
  * Addition of keymaps? Not sure they are necessary, since creative key binding / unbinding in WoW usually accomplishes the same thing.
